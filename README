Seems broken on Snow Leopard on Intel Core Duo

PyMol is the only reason why I keep MacPorts around.  I am trying to put an
end to this by creatinga Homebrew Formula to install PyMol.

This Formula installs PyMol 1.3r2.  I have been unable to get any of the two
newer versions to compile on OS X Lion. YMMV on Mountain Lion.

__Instructions__

brew tap mazubieta/pymol
brew install pymol
